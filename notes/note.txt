How can I create a good architact in my app?
How can I create python package?

All those way I want to test out, some of them are packages, some of them are modules. 

When I look to my app I realize I need some way to Interact with the app which is the UI part, some way I need to store data which is memory base storing, file base and database, to make my life easier when using DB I can use ORMs and finally I need some logic to Interact between UI and the storing part.

In MVC model, the storing part called Model, UI part called View and the Logic part called Code. So I can use MVC architact to create my application.

I don't know how to it correctly but I want to log my journy.
